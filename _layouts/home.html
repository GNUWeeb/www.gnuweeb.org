              I don't really know the history of this community. I will write as

              This community firstly appeared on Telegram @GNUWibu. This
              community was firstly created by @mnabila. It was named GNU/Wibu.
              I knew this group from @GNULinuxIndonesia group.

              I was not a highly active member in this community, I was just a
              lonely soul and not really interested in the conversation. I
              didn't have much time to communicate with this community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several months later, I don't really know what was going during
              that time. I just saw @Ryne4S as the group owner, and several
              members who I know had left the group, some of them are @rLapz,
              @mnabila (yes the group creator), (some people I've forgotten
              their username).
            </p>
            <p>
              And everything went well after that. I don't really care about,
              though.
