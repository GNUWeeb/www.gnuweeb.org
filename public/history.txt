I don't really know the history of this community. I will write as much
as I know.

This document will be updated as soon as there is a legitimate party
who cares to tell the story of history of this community.


This community firstly appeared on Telegram @GNUWibu.

This community was firstly created by @mnabila. It was named GNU/Wibu.
I knew this group from @GNULinuxIndonesia group.

Someone with username @ddrm_phrase sent this message at 8 Februbary 2020,

I was not a highly active member in this community, I was just a lonely
soul and not really interested in the conversation. I didn't have much
time to communicate with this community.

Several months later, I don't really know what was going during that time.
I just saw @Ryne4S as the group owner, and several members who I know had
left the group, some of them are @rLapz, @mnabila (yes the group creator),
(some people I've forgotten their username)

And everything went well after that. I don't really care about, though.
