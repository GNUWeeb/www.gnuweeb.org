		<p>I don't really know the history of this community. I will write as much as I know.</p>

		<p>This document will be updated as soon as there is a legitimate party who cares to tell the story of history of this community.</p>

		<p>This community firstly appeared on Telegram @GNUWibu.</p>

		<p>This community was firstly created by @mnabila. It was named GNU/Wibu.</p>
		<p>I knew this group from @GNULinuxIndonesia group.</p>

		<p>I was not a highly active member in this community, I was just a lonely soul and not really interested in the conversation. I didn't have much time to communicate with this community.</p>

		<p>Several months later, I don't really know what was going during that time. I just saw @Ryne4S as the group owner, and several members who I know had left the group, some of them are @rLapz, @mnabila (yes the group creator), (some people I've forgotten their username)</p>

		<p>And everything went well after that. I don't really care about, though.</p>
